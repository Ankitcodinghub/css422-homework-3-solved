Q1. (2pts) Multiplication with shift instructions

MOV R0, #100

MUL R2, R1, R0

Note that you cannot run the provided code in VisUAL, because MUL is not a supported instruction in VisUAL.

Q2 (6 pts) Memory map

Let‚Äôs assume that you‚Äôre using Keil uVersion. Fill out the blanks of the memory map (address 0x00000004 to address 0x00000014) when running the following assembly program.

THUMB

StackSize EQU 0x00000100

AREA STACK, NOINIT, READWRITE, ALIGN=3

MyStackMem SPACE StackSize

AREA RESET, READONLY

__Vectors EXPORT __Vectors

DCD MyStackMem + StackSize

DCD Reset_Handler

AREA MYDATA, DATA, READWRITE

dst SPACE 8

AREA MYDCODE, CODE, READONLY

src1 DCB

end_prog LDRB CBZ STRB

Q3. (12 pts) Pointer operations

On slide deck 6.ARM-InstrMem, we studied how to traverse a linked list using pre-indexed/register offset addressing. The following code intends to travers a linked list in search for a given value in R0 and returns the address of this value into R1 (but not the address of the node). If the value was not found, it returns 0 in R1, (i.e., a null address).

How about traversing a binary search tree?

R0 maintains a value to search. R1 first points to the tree root and is used to access each tree node. You can access its left pointer, right pointer, and value with

struct node {

struct node *left; // R1 struct node *right;// R1 + 4 int value; // R1 + 8

}

Using VisUAL, write a binary-tree search program. Your program searches for a value given in R0 and returns the address of this value into R1 (but not the address of the node). If the value was not found, it returns 0 in R1 (i.e., a null address).

Initialize a tree with the following code:

; left right value

node1 DCD 0x10C, 0x130, 4

node2 DCD 0x118, 0x124, 2

node3 DCD 0, 0, 1

node4 DCD 0, 0, 3

node5 DCD 0x13C, 0x148, 6

node6 DCD 0, 0, 5

node7 DCD 0, 0, 7

Verify the correctness of your program with three test cases: R0 = 0, R0 = 5, and R0 = 8.

What to submit: source code, screen shorts, and short explanations

1. (6 pts) Your source code named hw3q3.s: You need to add comment to each line of your code, otherwise, you get 0 for the coding part!

2. (6 pts) In the same file recording your answers to Q1 and Q2, add screenshots and explanations for the following three test cases

a. Test case 1 (where R1 = 0)‚Äôs screenshot of registers (R1 ‚Äì R13, LR, and PC) and a short explanation: 2pt

b. Test case 2 (where R1 = 5)‚Äôs screenshot of registers (R1 ‚Äì R13, LR, and PC) and a short explanation: 2pt

c. Test case 3 (where R1 = 8)‚Äôs screenshot of registers (R1 ‚Äì R13, LR, and PC) and a short explanation: 2pt

d. Copy your source code to the file after the test case screenshots and explanations.

2. a.

Case 1: When R0 = 0. The program will set R0 = 0, then get the value for what R1 point to, which is 0x4, and place it in R2. After that, the program will compare R2 and R0. Since 0 is less than 4, it will go to the left side of the binary search tree. Then move root point to root-&gt;left, and go back to the loop to compare R2 and R0. At this time, R2 changes to 0x2, which is still greater than R0. It will keep moving left. Then R2 will become 0x1, and the root will reach the end, which means the program does not find 0 in the BST. Out of the loop.

b.

Case 1: When R0 = 5. The program will set R0 = 0, then get the value for what R1 point to, which is 0x4, and place it in R2. After that, the program will compare R2 and R0. Since 5 is greater than 4, it will go to the right side of the binary search tree. Move the root to current = root-&gt;right, and check if it reaches the end. If not, go back to the loop, reset the value for the current node, and compare it with R0 since R6 is greater than R0. The node will go to the left side of the current node and check if it reaches the end. Then goes back to the loop to modify the current node‚Äôs value. Which is 0x5, and it is equal to R0, and it will go to found and return the address of R1.

c.

Case 1: When R0 = 8. The program will set R0 = 0, then get the value for what R1 point to, which is 0x4, and place it in R2. After that, the program will compare R2 and R0. Since 8 is greater than 4, it will go to the right side of the binary search tree.

Then move root point to root-&gt;right, and go back to the loop to compare R2 and R0. At this time, R2 changes to 0x6, which is still less than R0. It will keep moving right. Then R2 will become 0x7, and the root will reach the end, which means the program does not find 0 in the BST. Out of the loop.

d.
